# Lab assignment 1 - HTML & CSS

**Before attempting to solve this assignment, make sure you have read the [general lab instructions](page.en.php?id=labs).**

## About the lab assignment

In this first assignment, your task is to first structure a given text using HTML5 markup. The structure and markup you use should take advantage of the semantic tags provided by HTML5. You will then style the marked up content using CSS.   

## Learning outcomes

After completing this assignment, you should have aquired knowledge about:

* the syntax and structure of HTML: e.g. elements, tags, semantic tags, 
  attributes
* the syntax and structure of CSS: e.g. selectors, declarations, properties, 
  values, psudoselectors, grouping and nesting selectors 
* how content structure affects how style can be applied to the content
* the box model

## Submission and demonstration

The assignment should be demonstrated to your TA and then submitted to your TA as per the general lab instructions.

## Tasks

The assignment consists of three tasks

1. Markup the content using HTML5
2. Style the content using CSS
3. Write a short report describing the insights you make during task 1 and 2.

The tasks are described in detail below.

## HTML

Your first task is to mark up [this linked text](http://www.ida.liu.se/~729G26/labtemplates/lab1/lab1.txt) (right-click and "Save as...")using HTML5. This task is connected to the second task, so you will be moving back and forth between these tasks iteratively.

The images in [this folder](http://www.ida.liu.se/~729G26/labtemplates/lab1/images) (visit the folder and save the images) should also be included in a logical and fitting way in the final document.

The document should also be split into at least two separate HTML documents.

### Basic and advanced difficulty level for the HTML task

* All pages should validate as correct HTML5
* Use at least the following tags: article, div, nav, ol, ul, li, table, tr, td, img, p, header
* Use semantic HTML5 tags where applicable
* Each page should have a table of contents that can be used to navigate the  document.
* More than one heading level should be used
* Names of classes and id:s should be carefully considered
* The source text should be split into at least two documents, each with its own table of contents.
* The images used should be placed in a sub folder named `images`
* The content should be divided into at least two separate documents that link to each other.

## CSS

Your second task is to style the content you have created using CSS.

### Basic difficulty level for the CSS task
* The CSS should be defined in a style file, residing in the sub folder `css`.
* The text content should be contained by a single, center column with a fixed  width. This column should have a solid background color.
* All pages should have a background image set using CSS.
* Different font families are to be used for the different heading levels.
* The table of contents should be represented as an ordered list without visible bullets.

### Advance difficulty level for the CSS task

* All requirements for the basic difficulty level should be met
* The CSS file should be well organized and separate style and layout, i.e. style and layout declarations should not be mixed in the same selector block.
* The table of contents should float and be kept on a specific position on the screen. 
* The pages should use a responsive design.

## Report

Write a short (300-500 words) report.

### Basic difficulty level for the report

The report should contain the following

* Details about the insights you have made during this first lab assignment. What did you learn that was not obvious at first?
* Provide a description of each of the classes and id:s you have used in your document.
* Describe when to use a class over an id and vice versa.

### Advanced difficulty level for the report
* All requirements for the basic difficulty level should be met
* Give an example together with an explanation of how a badly structured HTML content can make styling the content more difficult.
* Discuss usage of a div with a custom class or id over using a semantic HTML5 element such as article or nav
