What is HTML5?
--------------

HTML5 will be the new standard for HTML.

The previous version of HTML, HTML 4.01, came in 1999. The web has changed a lot since then.

HTML5 is still a work in progress. However, the major browsers support many of the new HTML5 elements and APIs.
How Did HTML5 Get Started?

HTML5 is a cooperation between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).

WHATWG was working with web forms and applications, and W3C was working with XHTML 2.0. In 2006, they decided to cooperate and create a new version of HTML.

Some rules for HTML5 were established:

    * New features should be based on HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript
    * Reduce the need for external plugins (like Flash)
    * Better error handling
    * More markup to replace scripting
    * HTML5 should be device independent
    * The development process should be visible to the public


HTML Elements
-------------

An HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag. The start tag is often called the opening tag. The end tag is often called the closing tag.


HTML Element Syntax
-------------------

    * An HTML element starts with a start tag / opening tag
    * An HTML element ends with an end tag / closing tag
    * The element content is everything between the start and the end tag
    * Some HTML elements have empty content
    * Empty elements are closed in the start tag
    * Most HTML elements can have attributes

Most HTML elements can be nested (can contain other HTML elements).

HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.


HTML Tip: Use Lowercase Tags
----------------------------

HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>. Many web sites use uppercase HTML tags.

W3Schools use lowercase tags because the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends lowercase in HTML 4, and demands lowercase tags in XHTML.


HTML Attributes
---------------

    * HTML elements can have attributes
    * Attributes provide additional information about an element
    * Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    * Attributes come in name/value pairs like: name="value"


Always Quote Attribute Values
-----------------------------

Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotes.

Double style quotes are the most common, but single style quotes are also allowed.

Tip: In some rare situations, when the attribute value itself contains quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes: name='John "ShotGun" Nelson'


HTML Tip: Use Lowercase Attributes
----------------------------------

Attribute names and attribute values are case-insensitive.

However, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends lowercase attributes/attribute values in their HTML 4 recommendation.

Newer versions of (X)HTML will demand lowercase attributes.


HTML Block Elements
-------------------

Most HTML elements are defined as block level elements or as inline elements.

Block level elements normally start (and end) with a new line when displayed in a browser.

Examples: <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <table> 


HTML Inline Elements
--------------------

Inline elements are normally displayed without starting a new line.

Examples: <b>, <td>, <a>, <img>


The HTML <div> Element
----------------------

The HTML <div> element is a block level element that can be used as a container for grouping other HTML elements.

 The <div> element has no special meaning. Except that, because it is a block level element, the browser will display a line break before and after it.

When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to set style attributes to large blocks of content.

Another common use of the <div> element, is for document layout. It replaces the "old way" of defining layout using tables. Using <table> elements for layout is not the correct use of <table>. The purpose of the <table> element is to display tabular data.


The HTML <span> Element
-----------------------

The HTML <span> element is an inline element that can be used as a container for text.

The <span> element has no special meaning.

When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to set style attributes to parts of the text.


What are Semantic Elements?
---------------------------

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <img> - Clearly defines its content.


HTML5 <section> Element
-----------------------

The <section> element defines a section in a document.

According to W3C's HTML5 documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."


HTML5 <article> Element
-----------------------

The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.

Examples of where an <article> element can be used:

    * Forum post
    * Blog post
    * News story
    * Comment


HTML5 <nav> Element
-------------------
The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.

The <nav> element is intended for large blocks of navigation links. However, not all links in a document should be inside a <nav> element!


HTML5 <aside> Element
---------------------
The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).

The aside content should be related to the surrounding content.


HTML5 <header> Element
----------------------

The <header> element specifies a header for a document or section.

The <header> element should be used as a container for introductory content.

You can have several <header> elements in one document.


HTML5 <figure> and <figcaption> Elements
----------------------------------------

The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

While the content of the <figure> element is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow, and if removed it should not affect the flow of the document.

The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element.

The <figcaption> element can be placed as the first or last child of the <figure> element.

CSS
---

    * CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
    * Styles define how to display HTML elements
    * Styles were added to HTML 4.0 to solve a problem
    * External Style Sheets can save a lot of work
    * External Style Sheets are stored in CSS files

The CSS Box Model
-----------------

All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around HTML elements, and it consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

The box model allows us to place a border around elements and space elements in relation to other elements.

The image below illustrates the box model:



Explanation of the different parts:

    * Margin - Clears an area around the border. The margin does not have a background color, it is completely transparent
    * Border - A border that goes around the padding and content. The border is affected by the background color of the box
    * Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is affected by the background color of the box
    * Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear

In order to set the width and height of an element correctly in all browsers, you need to know how the box model works.

Dimension properties in CSS
---------------------------

The number in the "CSS" column indicates in which CSS version the property is defined (CSS1 or CSS2).

Property	Description								Values		CSS
height		Sets the height of an element			auto		1
													length
													%
													inherit
max-height	Sets the maximum height of an element 	none		2
													length
													%
													inherit
max-width	Sets the maximum width of an element 	none		2
													length
													%
													inherit
min-height 	Sets the minimum height of an element 	length		2
													%
													inherit
min-width 	Sets the minimum width of an element 	length		2
													%
													inherit
width		Sets the width of an element			auto		1
													length
