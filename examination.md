# Examination

The course is divided into to two parts:

* lab assignments 
* a mini project

You will be working in pairs during both the lab assignments and the mini project. Unless there are special circumstances, you should work together with the same partner for both parts. The work should not be partitioned between the students in a group and both students should be able to present the work the group submits.
